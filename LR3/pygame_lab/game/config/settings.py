HELP_TEXT = '''There are 20 waves in the game, 
on the 10th and 20th waves 
there are bosses who have a lot of lives
and a lot of damage, 
so it's better not to get caught by them.  
There are 10 types of monsters in total, 
someone has a lot of damage, 
but stands still, 
someone is just fast, but does not shoot, 
someone shoots very fast. Be careful.
The controls are quite simple:
- A movement to the left;
- D move to the right;
- Space bar makes a shot;
- W starts a new wave, 
but only if there are no enemies left on the field.

Good luck.'''
